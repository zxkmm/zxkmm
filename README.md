 - I'm a shorty who quietly cries in bed at night about my height issue which caused by lack of protein and calcium when I was young.  
 - I wear basketball attire every day to satisfying the overcompensation caused by inferiority complex of height.   
 - I love classical music, and I play the piano, but my parents couldn't afford (or didn't want to buy) one for me when I was young. So, I essentially learned to play the piano at subway stations and during high school, arriving early in the morning (or between classes) to practice.
- If my pathetic work has in any way helped you, please consider donating towards my height surgery (or hiring me).
