I'm a shorty who quietly cries in bed at night about my height issue which caused by lack of protein and calcium when I was young.  
I wear basketball attire every day to satisfying the overcompensation caused by inferiority complex of height.   
I love classical music, and I play piano, but my parents can't afford (or don't want to buy) me one when I was young, so basically I leaned my piano in subway station and high school (arrive earlier at morning to play or between classes).  
please consider donating me for my height surgery if my pathetic work helped you in some way.
